# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** Channel-agnostic outbound platform where EmailBison is just one provider behind an adapter, not the foundation everything depends on.
**Current focus:** v10.0 Phase 71 — Foundation (Constants, Interface & Registry)

## Current Position

Phase: 71 of 75 (Foundation — Constants, Interface & Registry)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-08 — Roadmap created for v10.0 (5 phases, 18 requirements)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key v10.0 decisions:
- [v10.0]: Option B — Channel adapters with unified read layer (not unified table). EmailBison owns email data, LinkedIn data is local, future channels will have their own providers.
- [v10.0]: Adapter interface contract: getLeads, getActions, getMetrics, deploy, pause, resume, getSequenceSteps
- [v10.0]: Portal, analytics, notifications call adapters — never import EmailBison or LinkedIn directly
- [v10.0]: Sender model stays shared table but queries go through adapters (no more channel filter scatter)
- [v10.0]: Incremental rollout — phase by phase, no big bang
- [v10.0]: Constants extracted FIRST (6 production bugs from raw strings). LinkedIn adapter built FIRST to validate interface is not email-shaped.

### Research Flags

- Phase 73 (Deploy): `deploy.ts` is most complex file to refactor — research exact function boundaries before starting
- Phase 74 (Portal): `CampaignDetailTabs` has channel-specific tab rendering that needs auditing

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None blocking v10.0.
